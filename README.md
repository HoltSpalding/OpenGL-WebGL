# OpenGL-WebGL

Holt Spalding
Computer Graphics Projects

The projects in the COMP-175 directory should all have executables
provided with them to make them easy to run. Glew and Glui must be installed to
compile them.  If running the executable in SceneView, load spongebob.xml 
in the SceneView directory. 

The Fragment Shader project is an example of how GLSL fragment shaders can be 
used in  WebGL.

I will eventually add my blender, solidworks, and three.js projects to this 
repository.
